/**
 * Interface for a USB device descriptor.
 * <p>
 * A device descriptor describes general information about a USB device. It
 * includes information that applies globally to the device and all of the
 * device’s configurations. A USB device has only one device descriptor.
 * <p>
 * A high-speed capable device that has different device information for
 * full-speed and high-speed must also have a device_qualifier descriptor.
 * <p>
 * The DEVICE descriptor of a high-speed capable device has a version number of
 * 2.0 (0200H). If the device is full-speed only or low-speed only, this version
 * number indicates that it will respond correctly to a request for the
 * device_qualifier desciptor (i.e., it will respond with a request error).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * See the USB 1.1 specification section 9.6.1.
